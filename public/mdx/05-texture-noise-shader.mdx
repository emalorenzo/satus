Loads a texture into a plane and distorts it using Noise3D. Mixes the color of the texture with white.
Vertex shader calculates noise and elevation and passes uv to fragment.
Fragment normalizes noise value, since it's between -1 and 1 and we need between on 0 - 1. Then it mixes the normalized noise value with white.
